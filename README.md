# Introduction
A plugin for Minecraft Velocity servers that allows to connect with the same account to the server several times. The plugin will assign a new username to each new connection using the same account. By using commands the players can change which MiniProfile (sub-profile) they are using. This plugin is heavily inspired by [TwinSession](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chatpatchertwin)
# Known issues
 - Chat messages don't work properly, so the plugin overwrites them, in newer versions of velocity this cant be done without the [ChatPatcher](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chatpatcher) plugin, so it's a requirement.
 - Right now, there are no configuration options, which mean that every feature is mandatory.
 - MiniProfiles can't be created without trying to connect with the same account.
